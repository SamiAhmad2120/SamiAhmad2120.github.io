    <h3> About Me: </h3>

<p1>
    Hello, my name is Sami, I'm a student at the CUNY College of Staten Island. 
    <br />I am on track to get a bachelors degree in Information Systems and Informatics. 
    <br />I switched to Information Systems from Computer Science because I had learned that I was more 
    <br />keen on the application theory of computers rather than the language of computer development. 
    <br />I love learning about computers and how they work, I build computer's in my spare time whenever 
    <br />im asked to help friend's/family. 
    <br />I hope to pursue more of computers other than just what I'm learning in class.

    I am a second generation Arab American, I'm half Palestinian and half Syrian.
    <br />I am also a muslim which is the core of who I am. I have alway's been fascinated by religion as a 
    <br />whole and have self studied almost every
    <br />major religion and their respective history. Ever since I was little kid I've been fascinated by history.
    <br />I love reading and studying the many different era's and events of humanity, examples being the 
    <br />Roman Empire, the discovery of America, and the celtic takeover of the 1200's.
    <br />I used to be a competitive swimmer in high school, and swimming is very much still a part of my life.
    <br />I am a swim instructor and a swim coach, I coach for the Staten Island Aquatics Club (SIAC) 
    <br />and also run private lessons at the YMCA.
    <br />I love working in teams and have alway's worked best in groups. I enjoy public speaking as it 
    <br />allows my voice to be heard, and I hope
    <br />that any chance I get I can further prove my dedication into anything I set my mind to.
