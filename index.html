    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Sami, I'm a student at the CUNY College of Staten Island. I am on track to get a bachelors degree in Information Systems and Informatics. I switched to Information Systems from Computer Science because I had learned that I was more keen on the application theory of computers rather than the language of computer development. I love learning about computers and how they work, I build computers in my spare time whenever I'm asked to help friends/family. I hope to pursue more of computers other than just what I'm learning in class.

    <p>
        I am a second generation Arab American, I'm half Palestinian and half Syrian. I am also a Muslim which is the core of who I am. I have always been fascinated by religion as a whole and have self-studied almost every major religion and their respective history. Ever since I was a little kid I've been fascinated by history. I love reading and studying the many different eras and events of humanity, examples being the Roman Empire, the discovery of America, and the Celtic takeover of Europe in the 1200's. I used to be a competitive swimmer in high school, and swimming is very much still a part of my life. I am a swim instructor and a swim coach, I coach for the Staten Island Aquatics Club (SIAC) and also run private lessons at the YMCA. I love working in teams and have always worked best in groups. I enjoy public speaking as it allows my voice to be heard, and I hope that any chance I get I can further prove my dedication into anything I set my mind to.

    <h3>My Top 5 Video Games:</h3>
    <ol style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 0;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Red Dead Redemption 2: (Arguably the best video game ever created. Here is a link to a Youtube video explaining why: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOV53IrgTGY">"Why Red Dead Redemption 2 is Perfect to Me"</a>)</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Dying Light 2: An amazing game with an intuitive parkour system. The combat is better than its prequel counterpart and makes up for its underwhelming story.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim: I game ive grown up with over the year's that brought me into RPG'S and my love for games</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Minecraft: the first game I've ever played and bring's me the fondest memories of constructing anything from my child imagination.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Team Fortress 2: My first ever multiplayer game that defined my enjoyment for competitive yet silly online experiences, the community is the funniest but also most deranged playerbase I've ever interacted with.</li>
